# PDF Voice Reader

This project originally started as a learning journey in Python, inspired by a tutorial from CodeWithHarry on creating a simple text-to-speech (TTS) robot using the `espeak` command. As I delved into Python and explored further, I decided to expand the project's scope and transform it into a PDF reader.

## About the Project

The PDF Voice Reader is a Python script that converts text from PDF files into speech, using the `espeak` command for speech synthesis. Initially designed for Ubuntu machines, the script is easily adaptable for other operating systems by modifying as per the need.

## Features

- Converts text from PDF files to speech.
- Utilizes the `espeak` command for speech synthesis (compatible with Ubuntu machines).
- Enhances accessibility, making it convenient for hands-free consumption of PDF content.

## Getting Started

1. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install PyPDF2

2. Specify the PDF file you want to read in the `pdf_file` variable within the script.



Feel free to modify or add any additional information that you think is relevant to your project or your learning journey.

Happy coding!
